![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

### Description
This application dynamically creates a professional level README.md through a command-line application using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The user only has to type node index.js in the terminal to begin the application. After this, the user is prompted to answer a series of questions regarding content on the README.md. Once this is completed, the user then has a new file called READMEHW.md that they can open and modify further or open in preview mode to view the final product.

When the user selects the type of license, a badge appears a the top of the readme. When they user opens the preview, they can click on links in the table of contents to navigate around the page.
